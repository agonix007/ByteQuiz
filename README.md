## Lessons Learned

I have learned in depth that how Js works. I also learned to work with DOM manipulation, Array methods, Strings and many more.

It was a great journey. I liked it very much.

The challenges which I faced is in the time of quiting any ongoing quiz. But I took the challenge and finished it in well manner.

## Optimizations

I have refactored my code by making it in a modular type. Every features I have created inside a funtion. The codes which were running again and again, I have made it a function.

I have also made reusable functions, which will also help me in future to use it in other applications.
